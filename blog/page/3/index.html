  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two items in the media have recently interested me.</p>

<p>The first was related to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. It was not the tragic incident itself that sent me scouring Wikipedia articles for information, but the way in which gun proponents in the United States immediately began screaming about their Second Amendment right to bear arms. In the UK, we are so used to instantly dismissing the cries of the gun lobby as ravings of lunatics, that we rarely listen to their arguments at all. No sane person, after all, could possibly justify possessing a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle for the purposes of self-defense or hunting; so why is it that these weapons are so readily available in the USA?</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Bill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg" alt="Bill of Rights" /></p>

<p>The second item, that flooded Hacker News and Twitter on the 12th and 13th of January, was news that Aaron Swartz had committed suicide. Aaron was a young man, who at the age of 14 had helped to develop RSS technology, had been a contributor to the phenomenon that is Reddit and had long been a proponent of Internet Freedom. Aaron’s suicide was almost certainly related to the fact that he was facing up to 35 years in a federal prison for allegedly downloading millions of academic articles from JSTOR, by hiding a networked laptop in a cupboard on MIT’s campus. Despite the fact that JSTOR did not wish to pursue any criminal charges against Aaron (all the documents having been returned), the Department of Justice mounted a prosecution case.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/AaronSwartzPIPA.jpg" alt="Aaron Swartz" /></p>

<p>So how are these two seemingly unrelated events related?</p>

<p>The Second Amendment right to bear arms is an anachronistic piece of constitutional law that dates back to a time when the ruling elite would assert their dominance over the common man through brute force. Having overthrown the British Imperial forces using armed militia, the founders of the United States wrote into their constitution that it was every civilian’s right to possess a firearm. This made absolute sense in the 1700s. If the newly formed Federal Government was ever to attempt suppression of the people that they had been elected to govern, they could potentially face huge numbers of armed civilians forming militias, ready to wrest back control of their county.</p>

<p>The power of the Second Amendment was demonstrated clearly during the American Civil War. When the South seceded, it was to the armed civilians that the Governors of the Southern States turned. Armed militia were formed from the citizenry and seized courthouses, treasury mints and federal forts. So began a war that would see over 600,000 soldiers and 50,000 civilians killed.</p>

<p>Let me state that I have no wish to defend the practice of slavery, but that does not make the following point moot: the citizens of the South felt that they had a right to own slaves, and they felt that President Lincoln was infringing on their civil liberties. To any civilized individual, then or now, their beliefs may have been contemptible, but that does not change the fact that they, ironically, felt they were being oppressed.</p>

<p>The Second Amendment, in its current form, is no longer relevant and needs to be updated. The last time that the Government in the United States used armed troops against its own citizens was to quell ant-war protestors in the late 60s and early 70s, and I doubt we will ever see such scenes again in our lifetimes. Even if we did, the Vietnam War protests, and since then the Occupy Movement, has shown how people can peacefully exert their combined power in acts of civil disobedience, and have a very real impact on their Government, without resorting to armed insurrection.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Flower_Power_demonstrator.jpg" alt="Flower Power demonstration" /></p>

<p>The threats to our civil liberties in the 21st century comes from a different quarter all together, as demonstrated by the prosecution of Aaron Scwartz. We should ask ourselves why it is that Aaron was pursued so zealously by the DOJ? Could it have been because of his outspoken opposition to the defeated SOPA and PIPA bills? Could it have been due to his release of approximately 20% of Federal Court documents from the PACER database into the public domain? Could it have been due to his connection to the MIT hackers that had links to Bradley Manning, as claimed by Cory Doctorow? Here was a young man whom cared nothing for material wealth, but everything for Internet Freedom, and for that he was facing the prospect of million dollar fines and nearly a life-time in jail.</p>

<p>Across the world our civil liberties are being threatened, spurred on by corporations that are quite happy to use their lobbying powers to protect their profits. In the USA, Congress recently passed the FISA Amendments Act that allows warrantless wiretapping of its civilians. In the UK, we face the threat of the &ldquo;Snooper&rsquo;s Charter&rdquo; that will require ISPs to log details of all their customers&#8217; web traffic, and the censorship of websites such as <a href="http://thepiratebay.se/">The PirateBay</a>.</p>

<p>The Second Amendment is fundamentally important; it just needs updating for the 21st century and it needs to be adopted by countries across the world. The weapons we use to defend ourselves in our modern era are no longer rifles, pistols and shotguns. Our &lsquo;arms&rsquo; in these times are social media platforms, P2P networks, and anonymous communication technologies such as the TOR network. It should be every citizen&rsquo;s right to communicate without fear of being monitored by the very politicians we placed in power or by their proxies. It should be every citizen&rsquo;s right to be able to access information without their activities being tracked by corporations or law enforcement. It should be every citizen&rsquo;s right to view information that has been created using public funding. It should be every citizen&rsquo;s right to share culture without fear of prosecution.</p>

<p>If we cannot trust our elected officials to preserve our civil rights, then it is our responsibility to &lsquo;arm&rsquo; ourselves. Organise, host or attend a <a href="https://cryptoparty.org/wiki/CryptoParty">CryptoParty</a>. Support those that are on the front line and who are trying to fight for your civil rights such as <a href="http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/">The Pirate Party</a> or the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. Use <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> when you browse the internet. Encrypt the data on your hard drive and use GPG encryption in all your sensitive emails. Last but not least, scream about Internet Freedom on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or even <a href="https://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora</a>. Tell Aaron Scwartz&#8217; story and other stories like his to anyone that will listen, and make sure our politicians know that if they will not protect our civil liberties, the electorate is &lsquo;armed&rsquo; and ready to act.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Michael Wilshaw, the new inquisitor-general over at Ofsted ( NOBODY expects Ofsted! Our chief weapon is surprise&hellip;surprise and fear&hellip;fear and surprise&hellip;. Our two weapons are fear and surprise&hellip;and ruthless efficiency&hellip;. Our <em>three</em> weapons are fear, surprise, and ruthless efficiency&hellip;and an almost fanatical devotion to Michael Gove.) has highlighted that mobile phones should be banned in schools to assists teachers in managing disruptive pupils.</p>

<p>While I commend Wilshaw for his no-nonsense approach to behaviour management, I really don&rsquo;t think he goes far enough. Some teachers, particularly ICT teachers, have publicly stated that banning mobile devices removes a potentially invaluable resource from the classroom, and that we should be encouraging students to use their devices to access VLEs, to make audio notes in lessons, to work collaboratively with other students. What poppycock.</p>

<p>In my school, while banning mobile phones has improved behaviour a little, these devices only contributed to a small percentage of poor behaviour. There are other equally worrying factors that can turn a placid classroom into a scene from Lord of the Flies in seconds. We need to ban more than just mobile phones.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Pocket Calculators.</strong> Yes, they&rsquo;re great for doing sums, but shouldn&rsquo;t we be teaching these students mental arithmetic anyway. Calculators are a horrendous distraction, and their potential for ruining lessons was recently highlighted to me by a colleague in the maths department. She was forced to leave her lesson, in floods of tears, after some malicious young wretch had written the number 55378008 on his calculator and then turned it upside down. Be warned, if you&rsquo;re going to try this yourself then it is most definitely NSFW.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paper and Pens.</strong> I yearn for the days when students used to have to write on slates with sticks of chalk. Paper and pens are a constant source of disruption and should be banned immediately. Students use these infernal devices to write notes to each other, often of a malicious nature, and they are a major cause of bullying. Some students will doodle incessantly while I am talking, not really paying attention to my series of lessons on correct paragraphing in Microsoft Word, and their doodles can often be horrendously graphic depictions of male genitalia. Worse yet, some particularly imaginative students have devised ways of fashioning potentially dangerous projectile darts from these sheets of paper, that could easily &ldquo;have someone&rsquo;s eye out&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Two-pence coins.</strong> Students should be spot checked for these at the school gates and all two-pence coins should be confiscated immediately. In some extreme cases, it might be necessary to ban all denominations of coins. The miscreants at my school have devised a clever little distraction they call penny football. This involves flicking the coin across a table while the teacher&rsquo;s back is turned in an attempt to get it as close to the edge as possible. the coin is then launched into the air, often flying across the classroom, with the serious potential of &ldquo;having someone&rsquo;s eye out&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digits.</strong> I don&rsquo;t think any school can be a truly productive environment while we allow students to brazenly walk the corridors with the full compliment of eight fingers and two thumbs. Not only have students developed devious and secretive communication methods using these devices, such as the extension of their middle-finger from a closed fist, but these things can be a horrendous distraction. Drumming at tables or incessant tapping has recently begun to infect my classroom, and I really don&rsquo;t see a way of preventing this short of amputation. One colleague in the PE department also explained how dangerous digits can be. He had allowed the students to have their fingers out to assist in his series of lessons on throwing and catching, only to find that the students were occasionally poking each other with their index fingers. He told me how worried he was that they would &ldquo;have someone&rsquo;s eye out&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genitalia.</strong> We&rsquo;ve all been there. Puberty is a difficult time for students. Hormones are a major factor in classroom disruption causing erratic and often aggressive behaviour. Furthermore, as students develop, their sexual urges can become so great that they would actually prefer to talk to the opposite sex rather than listen to my series of lessons on correct paragraphing in Microsoft Word. While it is difficult to ban genitalia, I would recommend that all primary school children are chemically castrated to prevent future disruption to secondary school lessons. In my own subject (ICT and Computing) I can&rsquo;t think of a single example of where chemical castration has adversely affected the development of academic progress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The prefrontal cortex.</strong> Student&rsquo;s are devious, manipulative and calculating. They&rsquo;re constantly developing new ways to misbehave and disrupt lessons. By banning the connections between the prefrontal cortex and the rest of their brain, behaviour in lessons would dramatically improve. The leucotomy is a simple enough procedure, that could be carried out the moment a student reaches secondary school age. With a classroom filled with lobotomised students, I would finally be able to deliver my series of lessons on correct paragraphing in Microsoft Word without a single interruption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Children.</strong> We&rsquo;ve all thought it. Remember your last training day? The corridors quiet, the classrooms peaceful. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if every day was like that? Banning students from schools would, in one fell swoop, eradicate poor behaviour forever. In one progressive school in Denmark, banning students from school has seen the number of external exclusions drop an impressive 100%. Additionally, with zero students on-roll, attendance is at +-infinity as is their A*-C percentages. You just can&rsquo;t argue with statistics like that.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So there we have it. My answer to improving behaviour in schools. Come on Wilshaw, don&rsquo;t be soft. Let&rsquo;s all get on that slippery slope and see where it takes us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Gove said to the world “ICT is no more,<br/>
The curriculum’s going out of the front door.<br/>
It’s coders we need and I need not disguise,<br/>
You should all teach computing on Raspberry Pi’s.”</p>

<p>A school full of hackers’<br/>
That’s of course what we need,<br/>
The games companies desperate,<br/>
Many gamers to feed.</p>

<p>But what Gove failed to say,<br/>
As the subject was shot,<br/>
We need teachers to teach it,<br/>
And to teach it a lot,</p>

<p>And those teachers can teach,<br/>
So the Heads have all heard,<br/>
In Excel or in Access or perhaps just in Word,<br/>
But of Java and Python and Lua and C,<br/>
These teachers know nothing, not even VB.</p>

<p>So how can they teach all these eager young pupils,<br/>
Of Arrays and of Loops and of Ifs and of Tuples.<br/>
They simple can’t do it they’ll, need costly training,<br/>
And the Heads’ eagerness is suddenly waning.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry says Gove, you don’t need to fret,<br/>
I was telling white lies when I spoke out at BETT.<br/>
There’s no need to teach ICT in particular,<br/>
Why don’t you just all go and teach cross-curricular?”</p>

<p>“Historians, Chemists, Mathematicians you see,<br/>
You don’t need to be skilled to teach ICT.”<br/>
“But you said computing, that’s what we all heard”<br/>
“But I am a Tory, you can’t trust my word.”</p>

<p>“When I said computing I meant in the grammars,<br/>
Not comps where the kids barely have any manners,<br/>
Your students are not academically able<br/>
They couldn’t tell fiber from coaxial cable”</p>

<p>So the heads give a sigh of enormous relief,<br/>
And silently thanked the old ICT thief.<br/>
They can sack a few teachers and call the job done,<br/>
No computers to buy that’ll cost them a ton,<br/>
No Head of Computing they’ll need to anoint,<br/>
And the students can go back to old PowerPoint.</p></blockquote>
