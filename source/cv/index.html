	  <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
	</div>

	<div class="sectionContent">
	  <p>I'm a passionate teacher with over 12 years experience in the disciplines of Science, Computing and Martial Arts. I've worked in a variety of schools; as a teacher, a curriculum leader and a network manager, and have consistently been rated Outstanding by OfSTED and my line managers.</p>
	  <p>I'm as comfortable in the Terminal as I am in the Classroom, and believe that both software and education should be free (as in speech and as in beer). </p>
	  <p>I'm an active blogger, and ramble at <a href='http://www.coding2learn.org'>www.coding2learn.org</a>. I've had the pleasure of hitting the front page of Hacker News twice, and had one of my posts go viral on Reddit.</p>

	  <h2>Teacher of Computing and Systems & Control - <a href="http://www.bourne-grammar.lincs.sch.uk">BGS</a></h2>
	  <p class="subDetails">September 2013 - Present</p>
	  <p>Currently the KS3 Coordinator for Systems & Control and the KS3 and 4 Coordinator for Computing at Bourne Grammar School.  I've turned the curriculum on its head since September, switching the school from ICT to Computing in a <em>Big-Bang</em> approach. Our students start their coding journey with Scratch, before transitioning to HTML/CSS and then jquery. By Year 8 our students are coding in Python using Sublime Text and diving into the Pygame and Tkinter libraries.</p>

	  <h2>Curriculum and Network Manager - <a href="http://www.sirharrysmith.cambs.sch.uk/">SHSCC</a></h2>
	  <p class="subDetails">September 2009 - August 2013</p>
	  <p>Managed a team of between three and five teachers and two network technicians. While continuing to improve GCSE and A-Level results, I transitioned the school from an ICT curriculum and began to introduce Computing. Simultaneously, I was responsible for the stability, security and development of the school's computer network. My greatest accomplishment, however, was building such a hardworking, cooperative and supportive team of teachers.</p>

	  <p class="subDetails">1999 - 2001</p>
	  <p>Under the auspices of VSO, I taught for two-years in the remote town of Kiunga, PNG. This was an exceptionally challenging role, as the school was under-resourced and lacked finances. I developed a science curriculum for the school and all the teaching and learning resources.</p>
