I've been meaning to write something about my thoughts regarding the open source movement and education for awhile. Today something cropped up in my Twitter feed that spurred me to finally do it.

Google have recently announced [Classroom](http://www.google.com/edu/classroom), a new service tied into Google Apps for Education. On the surface it looks great. It looks like the beginnings of a learning platform, but done properly, with a focus on documents and communication rather than on pretty looking UIs that are tortuous and slow to use.

I don't doubt that Google is being honest when they claim that...

> Like the rest of our Google Apps for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes, and is free for schools.

After all, Google have little interest in students who have very little purchasing power and therefore provide a poor return on targeted advertising. I believe that the gains for Google are that more students will become familiar with Google Apps, comfortable using Google Docs and reliant on Google Drive. They're making an investment in their future. By giving their services away for free, to teachers, they capture a large number of students and therefore guarantee a larger market share in the future.

[Aral Balkan](https://twitter.com/aral) has similar opinions to mine on Google and in particular Google Apps for Education. In his talk [Free is a Lie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwWMrDbvpzE) he takes questions at the end and is asked at around the 50 minute mark what his opinions on Apps for Education are.

> We have open alternatives... you don't want to make this the norm.

The rest of Aral's talk is well worth watching. He has some excellent points to make. I can't agree with him on 100% on his key points however. Aral argues that open source must be design led, and that unless we get the design correct (an by this he is generally talking about User Experience), then we'll never be able to persuade people that open source software and hardware or viable alternatives.

For the vast majority of people, now out of school and getting on with the important things in life such as earning their living, falling in love, raising children, I couldn't agree more. Most people haven't the time or inclination to get to grips with open source software that has been hacked together by a group of volunteers whose priorities were function over form. I recently set up a laptop with Ubuntu installed on it for my wife, and it sat unused until I reinstalled Windows. She's not interested in learning a new OS, or using Libre Office. It's more stuff to learn, and she doesn't see the point. This is not that case for children though.

My son is six. He loves his iPad and he loves his Raspberry Pi. For him, the iPad was not intuitive. He learned to use it. His Raspberry Pi was not intuitive. He learned to use it. He has a sheet of paper with a bunch of terminal commands scrawled on it, that he uses when he wants to fire up Minecraft on his Pi, and he doesn't give it a second thought.


My issue with this can be pretty much summed up by the headline that Google proudly displays on the Classroom page...

> More teaching, less tech-ing

This from the world's most prolific technology company.

Don't get me wrong. I can see the appeal to an English, Math or French teacher. They don't want to get tied down with technology. They don't want to have to fire up a terminal emulator every time they want to start planning their lessons. Nor should they. That's my job. As a teacher of Computing, it it incumbant upon me to make sure I am producing a generation of students that are tech savvy.
