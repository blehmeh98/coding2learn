It's been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but I'm not sure that I agree, which is why when my brother pointed this article out to me [Kids Can't Compute -- And That's A Problem](http://www.forbes.com/sites/netapp/2013/11/14/kids-cant-compute-problem/), I was a little pissed.

I didn't expect [Kids Can't Use Computers... And This Is Why It Should Worry You](http://coding2learn.org/blog/2013/07/29/kids-cant-use-computers/) to go viral, but it did. Some guy on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com) was talking about kids not being digital natives, and I responded to him with a [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6186588), that included a link to the blog post I'd written a week or so earlier. The next thing I knew, it had been posted to HN and hit the front page, then it hit Reddit and then things got silly.

I found it flattering that so many people linked to the article on Twitter, Facebook and Google+. I found it even more flattering when the reaction posts started coming in. Most flattering of all was the requests to translate the article into French, Russian, Spanish and Italian.

What is not flattering is the laziness of [Mike Elgan](https://twitter.com/MikeElgan) and his article in Forbes. It's like he's swallowed my entire blog post, digested it of all its nutrients and and then evacuated his bowels all over the Internet.

With minor alterations, he's copied the title, style and spirit of the original post. He obviously left out the anecdotes as he has none of his own to contribute. He fucked up the title, implying that kids can't _calculate_, which is a little odd. What irks me the most however, is that he doesn't even have the decency to throw in a back-link to my site, a quick mention of [@coding2learn](https://twitter.com/Coding2Learn) or even any hint that what he's writing might not be 100% original content.

Maybe this is the way things are done now in tech-journalism. Maybe they just scour the Web with their fingers hovering over ctrl+c, ctrl+v (I doubt most of them have heard of wget). Maybe this is acceptable to online magazines like [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com). If it is, so be it. I have no intention of doing anything other than writing this post and publicising it a little on Twitter, but I can't help but wonder whether Mike Elgan was paid for the article and if so how much?
