When I was a kid I played a lot of computer games. I once played Betrayl at Krondor for so long that I started hallucinating from sleep deprivation. When I was at Uni I chose to mow-down humanoid warthogs in Duke Nuk'em rather than learn metabolic pathways for amino acid synthesis and failed an importan exam.

Thank goodness I've put all that behind me and no longer play stupid games that seem to serve no more purpose than making variable values gradually increase the more you play them.

The Hacker News Game.

I've been playing The Hacker News game for just under a year. When I first started playing I was killed fairly quickly, what's known in HN circles as being hell-banned. It's a neat little concept where by the Games Masters introduce large amounts of lag into the game and hide your character from the other players.

My second attempt at playing has been a little more succesful, and I have gained nearly 1000xp, known as Karma in the game. The concept of The Hacker News Games is to go on a search for interesting websites that would be of interest to Programmers and Technologists. When you find a website, you submit it to the community, who can then upvote your submission and reward you with xp.

Like most MMORPGs, The Hacker News games allows you to interact with other players using comments. Comments can also be upvoted, for additional xp, and if you are a high enough level you can even down vote comments.
